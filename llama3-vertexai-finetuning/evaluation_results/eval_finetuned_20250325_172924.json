Using the third equation, we get W4 = 2 * (W1 - 3). With the fourth equation, we have W5 = (2 * W1 + 2 * (W1 - 3)) / 4 = (2 * W1 + W1 - 3) / 2 = (3 * W1 - 3) / 2\nRe-write the fifth equation,\nW1 + (3 * W1 - 3) / 2 = 35. Multiply by 2 to get rid of the fraction, 2 * W1 + 3 * W1 - 3 = 70,5 * W1 - 3 = 70.

      "reference": "Firstly, to solve this puzzle, we must consider the volume of the cube where a point must lie to be within 1 unit from an edge. This comprises 1 unit thick layers along all edges and corners. Along each face, there are strips of width 1 unit, which give us 6 areas of 1x3 units. However, the corners are counted thrice and the edges are counted twice. Therefore, we need to subtract the corner contributions. Each corner, consisting of one-eighth of a cube with side length 1 unit, has a volume of 1/8 units. Since there are 8 corners, these account for 1 unit of volume which we need to subtract once as they are over-counted twice, once for each of the three adjoining strips. Next, we deduct half the volume of each small edge cube (which has a volume of 1 unit) since they are counted in two adjoining strips along the face, giving us 12 half units to subtract. So, the total 'edge-near' volume is 6*3 - 1 - 6 = 11 cubic units. The volume of the entire cube is 3^3 = 27 cubic units. Thus the probability is 11/27.",
